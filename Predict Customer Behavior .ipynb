    "\n",
    "1. **What are you being asked to do?**<br>\n",
    "Predict if a customer will **not** leave a tip.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What are the ethical implications of the model? What are the consequences of your model making errors? What is the likely effect of the model when it predicts a false negative (i.e., when the model says a customer will give a tip, but they actually won't)? What is the likely effect of the model when it predicts a false positive (i.e., when the model says a customer will not give a tip, but they actually will)?**<br>\n",
    "Drivers who didn't receive tips will probably be upset that the app told them a customer would leave a tip. If it happened often, drivers might not trust the app.\n",
    "Drivers are unlikely to pick up people who are predicted to not leave tips. Customers will have difficulty finding a taxi that will pick them up, and might get angry at the taxi company. Even when the model is correct, people who can't afford to tip will find it more difficult to get taxis, which limits the accessibility of taxi service to those who pay extra.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Do the benefits of such a model outweigh the potential problems?**\n",
    "It's not good to disincentivize drivers from picking up customers. It could also cause a customer backlash. The problems seem to outweigh the benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Would you proceed with the request to build this model? Why or why not?**\n",
    "No. Effectively limiting equal access to taxis is ethically problematic, and carries a lot of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Can the objective be modified to make it less problematic?**\n",
    "We can build a model that predicts the most generous customers. This could accomplish the goal of helping taxi drivers increase their earnings from tips while preventing the wrongful exclusion of certain people from using taxis."

    "Suppose you were to modify the modeling objective so, instead of predicting people who won't tip at all, you predicted people who are particularly generous&mdash;those who will tip 20% or more? Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What features do you need to make this prediction?**\n",
    "Ideally, we'd have behavioral history for each customer, so we could know how much they tipped on previous taxi rides. We'd also want times, dates, and locations of both pickups and dropoffs, estimated fares, and payment method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What would be the target variable?**\n",
    "The target variable would be a binary variable (1 or 0) that indicates whether or not the customer is expected to tip ≥ 20%.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What metrics will you use to evaluate the model?**\n",
    "This is a supervised learning, classification task. We could use accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, area under the ROC curve, or a number of other metrics. However, we don't have enough information at this time to know which are most appropriate. We need to know the class balance of the target variable."

    "**Interpret:** The model is twice as likely to predict a false negative than it is to predict a false positive. Therefore, type II errors are more common. For our use case, this would be more desirable, because it's better for a driver to be pleasantly surprised by a generous tip when they weren't expecting one than to be disappointed by a low tip when they were expecting a generous one. However, it's unlikely that this model would be deployed without further development to significantly improve its performance."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  \n",
    "This is not a great model, but depending on how it's used it could still be useful. If the objective is only to help give taxi drivers a better idea of whether someone will leave a good tip, then it could be useful. It may be worthwhile to test it with a select group of taxi drivers to get feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your highest scoring model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",
    "Unfortunately, XGBoost is not the most transparent machine learning algorithm. We know that `predicted_fare`, `mean_duration`, and `mean_distance` are the most important features, but we don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**   \n",
    "There are almost always additional features that can be engineered, but hopefully the most obvious ones were generated during the first round of modeling. In our case, we could try creating three new columns that indicate if the trip distance is short, medium, or far. We could also engineer a column that gives a ratio that represents (the amount of money from the fare amount to the nearest higher multiple of $5) / fare amount. For example, if the fare were \\\\$12, the value in this column would be 0.25, because \\\\$12 to the nearest higher multiple of \\\\$5 (\\\\$15) is \\\\$3, and \\\\$3 divided by \\\\$12 is 0.25. The intuition for this feature is that people might be likely to simply round up their tip, so journeys with fares with values just under a multiple of \\\\$5 may have lower tip percentages than those with fare values just over a multiple of \\\\$5. We could also do the same thing for fares to the nearest \\\\$10.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$round5\\_ratio = \\frac{amount\\ of\\ money\\ from\\ the\\ fare\\ amount\\ to\\ the\\ nearest\\ higher\\ multiple\\ of\\ $5}{fare\\ amount}$$   \n",
    "\n",
    "  <details>\n",
    "    <summary><h5>HINT</h5></summary>\n",
    "  $$ = \\frac{5 - (fare\\ mod\\ 5)}{fare\\ amount}$$  \n",
    "  </details>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?**   \n",
    "It would probably be very helpful to have past tipping behavior for each customer. It would also be valuable to have accurate tip values for customers who pay with cash.\n",

If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? What insights can you report back to stakeholders?"
